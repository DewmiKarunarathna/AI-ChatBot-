# AI-ChatBot-
I am going to learn about advanced python parts by making a simple chatBot

# Features:
-patterns attribute to identify patterns in the conversation with the user
-
# What i am learning from this:
- __init__ is used to initialize the constrctor, the instances are created by using class_name.instance_name : value
- the undescore before the method is to indicate that it's a private method
- we can initialize a dictionary by dictonary_name = { value1 : assinged val1, value2 : assinged val2,...}
- the imported "re" library is used to identify patterns in converations, format : r'\b(text1|text2|....)\b' : function to call/ what to do when the required response is matched
